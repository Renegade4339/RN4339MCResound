# Renegade4339's Minecraft Resound Pack

It's been a while since I made resource packs for Minecraft. I went on to decide to make another but this time in my own liking. I then cobbled up some sounds from various mods and games and mishmashed into a single pack that's compatible with both Java and Bedrock. Java Aspects compatibility is included. For such to take effect over Java Aspects, it must be above the pack in question.

## Switching Compat Modes

To switch compatibility between Java and Bedrock, in Java, the pack must be a .zip file and thus pasted to the resourcepack directory in your profile[^1]. In bedrock, the filename extension shall be renamed as .mcpack and can be either dragged directly into the resource pack directory or opening it for mc to import it.






[^1]: Trivia: Minecraft Java supports .zip files for resource packs. Same goes for Bedrock but the extension name being .mcpack
